\maketitle

The purpose of Game Manager is to keep track of games. It should produce a list
of games for each storage and a list of storages for each game. It should also
raise an alarm for each owned game which is also present in the wishlist. It
should be able to add storages and add/remove games in each list.\\
The Manager should generate a 'random game recommendation'. The recommendation
should depend on the overall attractiveness of the game, storage priority, and 
whether the game is owned or on wishlist.
